## Deploying a Vite Project to Netlify with Environment Variables

1. Push your Vite project to a Git repository, such as `GitHub` or `GitLab`.

2. Log in to your `Netlify` account, or create a new account if you don't already have one.

3. Create a new site from Git, and select the repository that contains your Vite project.

4. Configure the build settings for your site. Set the build command to npm run build and the publish directory to `dist` (if required).

5. Set the `environment variables` for your site by going to the "Settings" > "Build & Deploy" > "Environment" section in your Netlify dashboard. Add any environment variables that your Vite project requires, including any environment variables prefixed with <b>VITE\_</b>.

6. Deploy your site by clicking the "Deploy site" button in the Netlify dashboard.

7. Your Vite project should now be live and accessible at the URL provided by Netlify.

By following these steps, you can easily deploy your Vite project to Netlify and access your environment variables in your code using the import.meta.env object.
